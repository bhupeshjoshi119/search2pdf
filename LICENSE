copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

1) Preserve license and copyright notices
   The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in
   all copies or substantial portions of the Software and in any distributed
   binary or source form.

2) Project-level Attribution Requirement (additional to the permission above)
   NOTWITHSTANDING THE PERMISSIONS GRANTED ABOVE, any public distribution,
   public-facing deployment, or public display of the Software (including but
   not limited to browser extension packages, bundled binaries, hosted
   services, or any service where the Software provides end-user
   functionality) must include a clear and reasonably prominent attribution to
   the original content author(s). The minimum attribution text required is:

       "Contains parts derived from 'GEN AI' by Bhupesh Joshi
       (https://github.com/bhupeshcoding/) — used under CC BY 4.0."

   The required attribution must appear in at least one of the following
   locations (choose the most appropriate for your distribution method):
   - the product's About or Credits page (if present), or
   - a visible UI location where end-users will reasonably see it (for
     example, extension About/Settings page, popup, or an Options page), or
   - the extension store listing / distribution page and the repository
     README or a NOTICE file included with the distribution archive.

   The attribution text must not be removed, obscured, or altered in a
   misleading way. For content that remains licensed under CC BY 4.0, comply
   with CC BY 4.0 attribution requirements as well (credit the original
   authors, provide a link to the license, indicate if changes were made).

3) Content license and third-party material
   Certain content included with the Software (text, images, examples, or
   other non-code material) is licensed separately under Creative Commons
   Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). Where such material is present,
   you must follow CC BY 4.0 attribution requirements in addition to the
   project-level attribution above. The original source of the CC BY 4.0
   content in this project is:

       Licensed under CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

   If you distribute or reuse actual text, images, or other content taken
   directly from "GEN AI" by Bhupesh Joshi, you must provide attribution,
   a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made, per CC BY 4.0.

4) DISCLAIMER
   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
   FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE

   LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM,

   THE SOFTWARE.

Notes:
- This LICENSE combines a permissive code license  with a project-level
  attribution requirement. It is a custom augmentation; if you need strong legal
  certainty, enforceability, or plan commercial enforcement, consult a lawyer.
- Keep a clear NOTICE/README and show attribution visibly in the extension UI
  and the store listing so downstream users comply easily.
